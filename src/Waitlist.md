# Email Campaign Implementation Checklist

## 1. Google Sheets Setup
- [x] Create a Google Sheet named "Email Campaigns" with columns:
  - `email`
  - `campaign_type` (waitlist, calendly_booked, calendly_abandoned_pending, calendly_abandoned)
  - `signup_timestamp`
  - `last_email_sent_day`
  - `next_email_scheduled_timestamp`
  - `campaign_status` (pending, active, completed, error, unsubscribed)
- [x] Set up Google Cloud Project, enable Google Sheets API, create Service Account, and share the sheet with the service account email.
- [x] Store credentials securely in your Next.js project.

## 2. Backend API Endpoints
- [x] `/api/waitlist` (handles Waitlist Form submissions) ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - [x] Validate and save email to Google Sheet with campaign_type 'waitlist'.
  - [x] Send Day 1 Waitlist email via Resend using templates.
  - [x] Update last_email_sent_day and next_email_scheduled_timestamp.
- [x] `/api/calendly-partial` (handles Calendly Form Abandonment capture) ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - [x] Save email to Google Sheet with campaign_type 'calendly_abandoned_pending'.
  - [x] Handle existing email logic (don't overwrite calendly_booked).

## 3. Scheduler (Cron Job)
- [x] Set up a daily (or more frequent) cron job (Vercel Cron Job) to trigger `/api/cron/send-emails`. ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] In `/api/cron/send-emails`: ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - [x] For each row with campaign_status 'active' or 'pending':
    - [x] If campaign_type is 'calendly_abandoned_pending' and signup_timestamp is older than threshold, mark as 'calendly_abandoned', send Day 1 Abandonment email, update fields.
    - [x] If next_email_scheduled_timestamp <= now, send the next email in the sequence, update last_email_sent_day and next_email_scheduled_timestamp, or mark as completed if sequence is done.
